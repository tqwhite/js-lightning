**WARNING**


These examples are rough. They are used in development and have not been groomed in anyway for use by people other than me. 

However, I think they all should work.

The easiest thing to do is `cd path/to/EXAMPLE_SITES/simplest` and type `jsl`. Visit `http://localhost:7000/test` in a web browser and *bobâ€™s your uncle.*

Remember, though, this whole thing is under active development. It might be broken.
